# Higher-loop-GNY-exponents
Collection of results for the critical exponents of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models from perturbative field theory

The files chiralIsing.m, chiralXY.m, and chiralHeisenberg.m include the critical exponents of the corresponding GNY model at four-loop order and in the 4-epsilon expansion. Literature: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05057

The file GNSO3-exponents.m includes the critical exponents for the model defined in https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10335 up to three-loop order in the 4-epsilon expansion and two second order in the large-N expansion.
